# SimpleSwap DApp

A simple decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented in Solidity that allows the exchange of ERC20 tokens with liquidity provision.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Try the application live:** [https://simpleswap-dex-dapp.vercel.app/](https://simpleswap-dex-dapp.vercel.app/)

Experience the full functionality of SimpleSwap DEX including:

- 🔗 MetaMask wallet connection
- 🪙 Mint test tokens (Token A & Token B)
- 💧 Add/remove liquidity to pools
- 🔄 Swap tokens with real-time pricing
- 📊 View pool reserves and account balances

## Features

- **Token Exchange**: Exchange ERC20 tokens in a decentralized manner
- **Liquidity Provision**: Add and remove liquidity to earn fees
- **Price Calculation**: Get real-time prices based on reserves
- **LP Tokens**: Receive liquidity tokens as proof of your contribution

## Main Contracts

- `SimpleSwap.sol`: Main exchange contract
- `TokenA.sol`: Example ERC20 token
- `TokenB.sol`: Example ERC20 token

## Functionalities

### 1. Add Liquidity

```javascript
addLiquidity(
  tokenA,
  tokenB,
  amountA,
  amountB,
  amountAMin,
  amountBMin,
  to,
  deadline
);
```

- Adds liquidity to the exchange pool
- Receive LP tokens as reward
- Requires token approval before transaction

### 2. Remove Liquidity

```javascript
removeLiquidity(
  tokenA,
  tokenB,
  liquidity,
  amountAMin,
  amountBMin,
  to,
  deadline
);
```

- Removes liquidity from the pool
- Burns LP tokens and returns underlying tokens

### 3. Swap Tokens

```javascript
swapExactTokensForTokens(amountIn, amountOutMin, path, to, deadline);
```

- Swaps an exact amount of input tokens
- Automatically calculates output amount

### 4. Query Prices

```javascript
getPrice(tokenA, tokenB);
```

- Gets the current price of tokenA in terms of tokenB
- Based on reserve ratio

### 5. Calculate Outputs

```javascript
getAmountOut(amountIn, reserveIn, reserveOut);
```

- Calculates the amount of tokens you will receive for a given input
- Includes exchange fees

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   npx hardhat coverage
   ```

### Test

```bash
  SimpleSwap Tests
    ✔ testing getAmountOut with zero amountIn (260ms)
    ✔ testing getAmountOut with zero reserves (45ms)
    ✔ testing addLiquidity with same token (88ms)
    ✔ testing add liquidity and mint LP tokens (44ms)
    ✔ testing getPrice (66ms)
    ✔ testing swapExactTokensForTokens (44ms)
    ✔ testing removeLiquidity (60ms)
    ✔ testing swapExactTokensForTokens with no liquidity (57ms)
    ✔ testing getReserves
